This document is about instruction while building a Proposal towards hackathon

### **1. PROJECT CONTEXT**

**What I'm Building:**
- AI-based tool for DPR (Detailed Project Report) preparation
- Automating high-quality, bankable proposals
- To unlock credit and investment access for MSMEs

**Purpose:**
- For a **HACKATHON submission**
- Goal: Get proposal **APPROVED** for presentation round
- NOT building the solution yet - just writing the proposal

**Technology Stack (Tentative):**
- Multi-Agent System using **LangGraph**
- **Gemini models** (Google)

---

### **1.1 HACKATHON TIMELINE (CRITICAL CONTEXT)**

| **Milestone** | **Date** | **Duration** |
|---------------|----------|--------------|
| Launch of Hackathon | 06/10/2025 | - |
| Application Submission | 27/10/2025 | 21 days |
| Shortlisting Announcement | 29/10/2025 | +2 days |
| Presentation of Solutions | 31/10/2025 | +2 days |
| Announcement of Winners | 04/11/2025 | +4 days |
| Deployment of POC | 06/11/2025 | +2 days |

**KEY INSIGHT:** Entire hackathon lifecycle = **1 MONTH**  
→ No need for 12-month implementation plans  
→ Focus on: Can you build a POC by Nov 6?

---

### **2. EVALUATION CRITERIA (WEIGHTAGES)**

| Criteria | Weightage | What They Want |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Problem-Solution Fit | 25% | How well solution addresses MSME challenges |
| Innovation & Originality | 25% | Novelty, creativity, unique use of AI/SaaS |
| Feasibility & Scalability | 20% | Technical feasibility, operational adoption, scaling ability |
| Implementation Strategy | 15% | Clarity of execution plan, milestones, iterative approach |
| Impact & Effectiveness | 15% | Measurable outcomes, contribution to MSME growth |

---

### **3. DOCUMENT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS**

**Length:**
- ✅ **8-12 pages MAXIMUM** (not 94 pages!)
- Crisp and easily presentable

**Format:**
- ✅ Visual-heavy (images, tables, flowcharts, sequence diagrams)
- ✅ Scannable in 5 minutes
- ❌ NOT extensive text documents
- ❌ NOT traditional government proposals

**Style:**
- Should look like a **tech startup pitch deck**
- Hackathon mode, not consultation mode

---

### **4. WHAT TO AVOID (CRITICAL)**

❌ **Don't explain the problem extensively**
   - They already know DPR preparation is hard
   - They know MSMEs face credit access issues
   - No need to justify WHY this is needed

❌ **Don't explain advantages/benefits extensively**
   - They know AI will save time/money
   - They know it will improve approval rates
   - No need to sell the concept

❌ **Don't write extensive text**
   - No long paragraphs
   - No detailed narratives
   - Not a report or whitepaper

❌ **Don't include source code**
   - No code examples
   - No technical implementation code
   - Keep it architecture-level

❌ **Don't deviate from page count**
   - Must stay within 8-12 pages
   - Already failed once (went to 94 pages)

❌ **Don't include unrealistic timelines**
   - No 12-month implementation plans
   - No multi-year roadmaps
   - This is a 1-month hackathon!

---

### **5. WHAT TO FOCUS ON (CRITICAL)**

✅ **HOW you will build it**
   - Technical architecture
   - Multi-agent system design
   - Technology choices and why

✅ **THAT you CAN build it**
   - Feasibility evidence
   - Existing tech/tools that enable it
   - Team capability
   - What you can build by Nov 6 (POC)

✅ **WHAT exactly you'll deliver**
   - Clear scope
   - Specific features
   - MVP vs full solution

✅ **WHEN it will be ready**
   - Realistic hackathon timeline
   - What's in the POC (by Nov 6)
   - Phased approach (if needed POST-hackathon)

✅ **Visual representations**
   - Diagrams over text
   - Flowcharts for processes
   - Tables for comparisons
   - Dashboards for metrics

---

### **6. CONTENT STRUCTURE (WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE)**

**They ALREADY KNOW:**
- DPR preparation is a problem ✓
- AI automation will help ✓
- This will save time/money ✓
- Approval rates will improve ✓

**They DON'T KNOW (Focus here):**
- How will YOU specifically build this?
- Can you actually deliver a POC in 1 month?
- What exactly will you build?
- What makes YOUR approach unique/feasible?

---

### **7. PROPOSED STRUCTURE (REFINED FOR HACKATHON)**

| Section | Pages | Focus |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Solution Overview | 1 | What we're building (diagram-heavy) |
| Technical Architecture | 1.5-2 | Multi-agent design, tech stack, core innovation (visual) |
| Feasibility Proof | 1.5-2 | Why we can deliver POC, tech readiness, risks (tables) |
| Expected Outcomes | 1 | Impact metrics (dashboard visuals) |
| **TOTAL** | **5-6 pages** | **Maximum visuals, minimum text** |

**REMOVED:** Implementation Plan section (not relevant for 1-month hackathon)

---

### **8. DOCUMENT APPROACH**

**Think of it as:**
- ✅ Tech startup pitch deck
- ✅ Investor presentation
- ✅ Solution showcase
- ✅ "Here's what we'll demo on Nov 6"
- ❌ NOT: Government tender response
- ❌ NOT: Academic research paper
- ❌ NOT: Detailed business plan
- ❌ NOT: 12-month project plan

**Target audience mindset:**
- Hackathon judges scanning 100+ proposals
- Looking for: "Can this team actually build a POC in 1 month?"
- Need to decide in 5 minutes: Invite for presentation or not

---

### **9. STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS**

**Agreed approach:**
1. Generate section by section
2. Wait for approval before proceeding
3. Keep each section crisp
4. Prioritize visuals over text
5. Stay within page limits
6. Focus on hackathon feasibility, not long-term plans

**My mistakes to avoid:**
- ❌ Generating too much content
- ❌ Going into problem explanations
- ❌ Writing like a traditional proposal
- ❌ Ignoring page count constraints
- ❌ Including unrealistic timelines for a 1-month hackathon

---

### **10. KEY REMINDERS**

**This is a HACKATHON, not a:**
- Business proposal
- Government tender
- Academic submission
- Consulting report
- Startup pitch to VCs

**The goal is:**
- Show you CAN build a POC in 1 month (by Nov 6)
- Show you WILL build it (technical feasibility)
- Show it's INNOVATIVE (uniqueness)
- Get selected for presentation round on Oct 31

**Success = Invitation to present, NOT funding approval**

### **12. PAGE COUNT TARGET**

**REVISED TARGET: 5-6 pages** (down from 8-10)

Why shorter?
- Hackathon, not business plan

- Section 1: 1 page
- Section 2: 1.5-2 pages  
- Section 3: 1.5-2 pages
