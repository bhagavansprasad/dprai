## Known Issues Documented:

### 1. Gemini API Rate Limiting
- **Issue:** 429 ResourceExhausted errors during execution
- **Impact:** Adds 4-8 second delays (auto-retry)

- **Solution:** Auto-retry mechanism handles it
- **Future:** Can add delays or upgrade API tier

### 2. Test Message Outdated
- **Issue:** dpr_main.py still says "Stage 1 Test Complete"
- **Impact:** Cosmetic only, no functional impact
- **Status:** Deferred (user choice: "leave as-is")
- **Future:** Can update when convenient
