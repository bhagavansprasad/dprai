# 🏆 AI-Powered DPR Automation Platform — Hackathon Proposal

## 1. SOLUTION OVERVIEW

### 🚀 What We're Building

> **AI-Powered DPR Automation Platform (Hackathon POC)**

* 🧠 3 specialized AI agents — SPV, Technical, Financial
* 🏭 **Sector-agnostic platform**, with POC anchored on **Printing Cluster sector**
* 🧮 **Standalone Agentic AI application built using LangGraph** (no frontend or backend included in POC)
* 📄 End-to-end DPR generation (MSE-CDP compliant)
* 📊 Real-time financial validation (NPV, IRR, DSCR)

📝 *Why Printing for POC?* — Printing is a mature MSME sector with structured DPR formats, making it ideal for fast and impactful hackathon demonstration.

### 🤖 Agent Specialization

| Agent         | Role                                   | DPR Sections  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| 🧑‍💼 SPV     | Promoter & SPV structure, governance   | 3–4           |
| 🧰 Technical  | Machinery selection, capacity planning | 8–9           |
| 💰 Financial  | NPV/IRR/DSCR, projections              | 10, 14, 19–20 |
| 🧭 Supervisor | Orchestration, state mgmt              | —             |

---

### 🧰 Technology Stack

| Component           | Technology                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Core Engine         | **LangGraph Standalone Application** |
| Orchestration       | LangGraph                            |
| AI Model            | Gemini 2.5 Pro (or latest available) |
| Knowledge Base      | ChromaDB (Vector DB)                 |
| Financial Engine    | Python (NumPy, Pandas)               |
| Document Generation | python-docx                          |
| Cloud               | Google Cloud Platform                |
| Future Frontend     | Node.js (planned)                    |
| Future Backend      | Python FastAPI framework (planned)   |

✅ The POC deliberately excludes frontend and backend to focus on **core AI agent functionality**. Future integration will be simple and modular.

---

### 🧠 Core Technical Innovation — Hybrid AI + Rules

```
AI Generation (Gemini) → Rule Validation (Python) → Feedback/Assemble
```

* ✅ Deterministic financial calculations
* ✅ Rule-based compliance (MSE-CDP)
* ✅ Prevents AI hallucinations
* ✅ Works for any MSME sector (Printing used for demo)
* ✅ Easily extendable with frontend/backend without rework

---

## 2. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### 🧠 2.1 Multi-Agent Workflow

```
LangGraph Standalone Application → SPV / Technical / Financial Agents
      ↓
Validation Engine (Python)  →  DPR Assembly → 📄 Final Output
```

✅ Parallel execution → validation → deterministic generation.

💡 *Extensible Architecture*: Future integration of Node.js frontend and Python FastAPI backend will be **plug-and-play** without changing the core agent flow.

### 🧭 2.2 Agent Interaction & State

| Agent      | Inputs                     | Processing       | Outputs        |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| SPV        | Cluster info               | SPV validation   | spv_data       |
| Technical  | Sector knowledge, capacity | Machinery lookup | technical_data |
| Financial  | Costs, SPV+Tech outputs    | NPV/IRR/DSCR     | financial_data |
| Supervisor | Global state               | Orchestrates     | Final assembly |

Shared state maintained in LangGraph ensures consistency across agents.

---

### 📚 2.3 Sector Knowledge Module (Configurable)

```
• Preloaded domain knowledge
• Sector-specific cost norms
• Capacity benchmarks
• DPR templates & rules
```

💡 POC: Printing sector, easily extensible to others.
