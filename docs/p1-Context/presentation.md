## **SLIDE 1 — CONCEPT OVERVIEW**

### **Title:**
**AI-Based DPR Agent (Agent TKI)**  
Autonomous Project Report Generation

### **Bullets:**
* AI that builds MSE-CDP compliant project reports
* Multi-agent collaboration system (LangGraph + Gemini)
* Learns from templates & approved samples
* **90% faster: 6 months → 3 days**
* No SME needed — fully autonomous

### **Visual Description:**

### **Speaker Notes:**
"Agent TKI is our AI-powered system that autonomously generates Detailed Project Reports for MSME clusters. Using a multi-agent architecture, it reduces DPR preparation time from 6 months to just 3 days—a 90% reduction. The system requires no subject matter experts and operates completely autonomously."

## **SLIDE 2 — INPUTS & KNOWLEDGE SOURCES**

### **Title:**
**What Powers Agent TKI**  
Three Knowledge Sources

### **Bullets:**
* **📋 Templates** → MSE-CDP structure & compliance rules
* **✅ Sample DPRs** → approved content patterns & quality benchmarks
* **📊 Project Data** → cluster-specific context (any industry)
* AI synthesizes all sources into validated draft

### **Visual Description:**
Three icons (Template document, Checkmark sample, Data chart) merging into AI Core, outputting Draft DPR

### **Speaker Notes:**
"Agent TKI is powered by three key knowledge sources. Templates provide the official MSE-CDP structure and compliance rules. Sample approved DPRs serve as quality benchmarks for content style and depth. Project data provides cluster-specific context. The AI synthesizes these three sources to generate domain-agnostic, high-quality drafts for any industry."

## **SLIDE 3 — AGENTIC WORKFLOW**

### **Title:**
**How Agent TKI Works**  
Autonomous Generation Pipeline

### **Bullets:**
* **Phase 1: Understand** → Extract project requirements
* **Phase 2: Generate** → Build 21 MSE-CDP sections
* **Phase 3: Validate** → Check compliance & quality
* Refines automatically until validation passes
* Zero manual intervention required

### **Visual Description:**

### **Speaker Notes:**
"The workflow operates in three autonomous phases. First, Agent TKI understands the project by extracting key requirements. Second, it generates all 21 mandatory MSE-CDP sections. Third, it validates output against compliance and quality standards. The system automatically refines content until validation passes—requiring zero manual intervention."

---

## **SLIDE 4 — 4-TIER VALIDATION FRAMEWORK**

### **Title:**
**4-Tier Validation Framework**  
Quality Assurance at Every Level

### **Bullets:**
* **Tier 1: Structure** → All mandatory sections present
* **Tier 2: Content** → Professional language, data completeness
* **Tier 3: Compliance** → MSE-CDP requirements (NPV, IRR, DSCR)
* **Tier 4: Quality** → Matches approved DPR benchmarks
* **Scoring:** Each section must achieve ≥80% to pass

### **Visual Description:**
Four stacked layers labeled Structure, Content, Compliance, Quality—each with checkmarks, forming a pyramid or filter

### **Speaker Notes:**
"Our validation framework operates on four tiers. Structure validation ensures all mandatory sections are present. Content validation checks for professional language and completeness. Compliance validation verifies MSE-CDP requirements like NPV greater than zero, IRR above 10%, and DSCR above 3:1. Quality validation benchmarks against approved DPRs. Each section must score at least 80% across all tiers to pass."

**Business Impact**  
Validated, Production-Ready DPRs

### **Bullets:**
* **21 MSE-CDP sections** → fully compliant output
* **90% time reduction:** 6 months → 3 days
* **95% cost reduction:** ₹2 lakhs → ₹10,000
* **Domain-agnostic:** Works for any MSME cluster
* Scalable multi-agent architecture for future expansion

### **Visual Description:**

### **Speaker Notes:**
"The business impact is substantial. Agent TKI generates all 21 MSE-CDP sections with full compliance. Time is reduced by 90%—from 6 months to 3 days. Cost drops by 95%—from ₹2 lakhs to ₹10,000. The system is domain-agnostic, working for any MSME cluster across industries. The scalable architecture enables future expansion to other document types."

## **SLIDE 6 — VALIDATION IN ACTION** ⭐ NEW

### **Title:**
**Validation in Action**  
Section-by-Section Quality Scoring

### **Bullets:**
* **Executive Summary:** 87% (Structure: 100%, Content: 88%, Compliance: 86%)
* **Financial Plan:** 92% (All MSE-CDP formulas validated)
* **Technical Feasibility:** 84% (Industry-appropriate content)
* **Auto-feedback:** "Add job creation numbers in impact section"
* Iterative refinement until all sections ≥80%

### **Visual Description:**
Dashboard/scorecard showing three section scores with color-coded progress bars (green for ≥80%), plus a feedback bubble with example suggestion

### **Speaker Notes:**
"Here's validation in action with real scores. The Executive Summary scored 87% overall—perfect structure at 100%, strong content at 88%, and solid compliance at 86%. Financial Plan achieved 92% with all MSE-CDP formulas correctly validated. Technical Feasibility scored 84% with industry-appropriate content. The system provides actionable feedback like 'Add job creation numbers' and automatically refines content until all sections exceed the 80% threshold."
