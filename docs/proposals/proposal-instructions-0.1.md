## **üìã MASTER INSTRUCTION LIST - PROPOSAL PREPARATION**

---

### **1. PROJECT CONTEXT**

**What I'm Building:**
- AI-based tool for DPR (Detailed Project Report) preparation
- Automating high-quality, bankable proposals
- To unlock credit and investment access for MSMEs

**Purpose:**
- For a **HACKATHON submission**
- Goal: Get proposal **APPROVED** for presentation round
- NOT building the solution yet - just writing the proposal

**Technology Stack (Tentative):**
- Multi-Agent System using **LangGraph**
- **Gemini models** (Google)

---

### **2. EVALUATION CRITERIA (WEIGHTAGES)**

| Criteria | Weightage | What They Want |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Problem-Solution Fit | 25% | How well solution addresses MSME challenges |
| Innovation & Originality | 25% | Novelty, creativity, unique use of AI/SaaS |
| Feasibility & Scalability | 20% | Technical feasibility, operational adoption, scaling ability |
| Implementation Strategy | 15% | Clarity of execution plan, milestones, iterative approach |
| Impact & Effectiveness | 15% | Measurable outcomes, contribution to MSME growth |

---

### **3. DOCUMENT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS**

**Length:**
- ‚úÖ **8-12 pages MAXIMUM** (not 94 pages!)
- Crisp and easily presentable

**Format:**
- ‚úÖ Visual-heavy (images, tables, flowcharts, sequence diagrams)
- ‚úÖ Scannable in 5 minutes
- ‚ùå NOT extensive text documents
- ‚ùå NOT traditional government proposals

**Style:**
- Should look like a **tech startup pitch deck**
- Hackathon mode, not consultation mode

---

### **4. WHAT TO AVOID (CRITICAL)**

‚ùå **Don't explain the problem extensively**
   - They already know DPR preparation is hard
   - They know MSMEs face credit access issues
   - No need to justify WHY this is needed

‚ùå **Don't explain advantages/benefits extensively**
   - They know AI will save time/money
   - They know it will improve approval rates
   - No need to sell the concept

‚ùå **Don't write extensive text**
   - No long paragraphs
   - No detailed narratives
   - Not a report or whitepaper

‚ùå **Don't include source code**
   - No code examples
   - No technical implementation code
   - Keep it architecture-level

‚ùå **Don't deviate from page count**
   - Must stay within 8-12 pages
   - Already failed once (went to 94 pages)

---

### **5. WHAT TO FOCUS ON (CRITICAL)**

‚úÖ **HOW you will build it**
   - Technical architecture
   - Multi-agent system design
   - Technology choices and why

‚úÖ **THAT you CAN build it**
   - Feasibility evidence
   - Existing tech/tools that enable it
   - Team capability

‚úÖ **WHAT exactly you'll deliver**
   - Clear scope
   - Specific features
   - MVP vs full solution

‚úÖ **WHEN it will be ready**
   - Realistic timeline
   - Milestones
   - Phased approach

‚úÖ **Visual representations**
   - Diagrams over text
   - Flowcharts for processes
   - Tables for comparisons
   - Dashboards for metrics

---

### **6. CONTENT STRUCTURE (WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE)**

**They ALREADY KNOW:**
- DPR preparation is a problem ‚úì
- AI automation will help ‚úì
- This will save time/money ‚úì
- Approval rates will improve ‚úì

**They DON'T KNOW (Focus here):**
- How will YOU specifically build this?
- Can you actually deliver?
- What exactly will you build?
- When will it be ready?
- What makes YOUR approach unique/feasible?

---

### **7. PROPOSED STRUCTURE (REFINED)**

| Section | Pages | Focus |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Solution Overview | 1 | What we're building (diagram-heavy) |
| Technical Architecture | 3-4 | Multi-agent design, tech stack, innovation (visual) |
| Implementation Plan | 2 | Timeline, milestones, team (charts) |
| Feasibility Proof | 1 | Why we can deliver, risks (tables) |
| Expected Outcomes | 1 | Impact metrics (dashboard visuals) |
| **TOTAL** | **8-10 pages** | **Maximum visuals, minimum text** |

---

### **8. DOCUMENT APPROACH**

**Think of it as:**
- ‚úÖ Tech startup pitch deck
- ‚úÖ Investor presentation
- ‚úÖ Solution showcase
- ‚ùå NOT: Government tender response
- ‚ùå NOT: Academic research paper
- ‚ùå NOT: Detailed business plan

**Target audience mindset:**
- Hackathon judges scanning 100+ proposals
- Looking for: "Can this team actually build it?"
- Need to decide in 5 minutes: Invite for presentation or not

---

### **9. STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS**

**Agreed approach:**
1. Generate section by section
2. Wait for approval before proceeding
3. Keep each section crisp
4. Prioritize visuals over text
5. Stay within page limits

**My mistakes to avoid:**
- ‚ùå Generating too much content
- ‚ùå Going into problem explanations
- ‚ùå Writing like a traditional proposal
- ‚ùå Ignoring page count constraints

---

### **10. KEY REMINDERS**

**This is a HACKATHON, not a:**
- Business proposal
- Government tender
- Academic submission
- Consulting report

**The goal is:**
- Show you CAN build it (feasibility)
- Show you WILL build it (plan)
- Show it's INNOVATIVE (uniqueness)
- Get selected for presentation round

**Success = Invitation to present, NOT funding approval**
